# 🧬 Use of Biopython in Pharmaceuticals

Welcome to this educational AI project designed for pharmaceutical and bioinformatics learners. This repository includes interactive Python case studies using **Biopython** to analyze gene sequences and protein structures — even if you're completely new to coding.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of an AI elective at Hochschule Ansbach under the guidance of **Prof. Dr. Sibylle Gaisser**. Our goal:  
To show how Biopython can be used to solve real-world problems in pharmaceutical research — in a simple, hands-on, and student-friendly way.

## 🧪 Case Studies Included

### ✅ Case Study 1: Gene Sequence Analysis  
- Tool: Biopython's `Entrez` and `SeqIO` modules  
- Task: Retrieve a gene from NCBI and analyze its base composition  
- Concepts: FASTA format, GC content, base frequency

### ✅ Case Study 2: Protein Structure Annotation  
- Tool: Biopython's `PDBParser` module  
- Task: Load a protein structure (e.g., hemoglobin), identify chains and residues  
- Concepts: Amino acid chains, structure parsing, chain IDs

## 🧑‍🎓 For Beginners

No coding experience? No problem.

- ✅ All code is explained step-by-step  
- ✅ Tasks are clearly marked with **TODO**  
- ✅ Each section starts with "What, Why, and How"  
- ✅ Designed for students in biotech, pharma, or AI
